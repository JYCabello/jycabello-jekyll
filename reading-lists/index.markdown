###### Metacognition
- [Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08PY44J1P) Steven Pinker took me on a journey on accepting that certain apparently irrational behaviours aren't, and provided me with plenty of tools to reason about the way I reason.
- [The secrets of consulting: a guide to giving and getting advice successfully](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004J35LHQ) While this is technically a book about consulting skills, I can't overstate how much of an insight into the way we accept new information this work has given me.
